# üëã Hey there! I'm a multipurpose Discord bot, including some amazing
features, like **leveling**, **music**, **economy** and
**media notifications**! All this and much more for free! # üìª You
like hearing music? Me too! First you need to join a voice channel the
bot should go into. For this use the command `~join`. Make sure I'm
not in a voice channel yet. You don't want to disturb other people
hearing music...
 Once I joined your voice channel you're good to go. Use `~play` to
play some amazing songs (or annoying). The music tracks will be added to
an queue, which is played in the correct order.
 You don't link the order? No problem! Use `~shuffle` to mix up the
queue. Then noone knows where his favorite song was.
 If you're done with the super mega music party use `~leave` to let
the bot leave the voice channel. She then also wants to rest a little.
# üèÜ Who's the most active? Well, what would be a bot without leveling?
Just write some messages and you'll gain experience. If you're in a
voice call with your friends, you'll gain experience as well. With a
certain amout of xp you reach a level. But don't take it too easy. It's
getting harder to reach a level every time! 
 You wan't to check your level? Use `~rank` to see your current
**xp**, **level** and **rank**. I'll display it to you on a
nice image, which you can customise using `~leveling background`!
 If you want to see who is the most active on your server, type in
`~leaderboard`. This will show you the 10 most annoying users! # üîî
Ping! You missed the latest stream/video of your favorite content
creator? Not anymroe! Add all your favorite streamers to a list using
the command `~notifications twitch `. The same works with YouTube!
Use `~notifications youtube ` to get notifications from a YouTuber! 
 If you want to see, who you added to your notifications list type in
`~notifications list`. With the reaction below the message you can
toggle between all YouTubers and Streamers. 
 If your favorite streamer banned you from the stream use the same
command as you added the streamer: `~notifications twitch `. This
will remove the streamer from the notifications list! Now you won't be
notified if the streamer goes live... For YouTubers its the same, just
use **~notifications youtube ** again. 
 You want to ping a role once you're live? Set up custom notification
messages for YouTube and Twitch! Use `~notifications message twitch `
to add a custom message once you're streamers are live! As always, do
the same for YouTube: `~notifications message youtube ` 
 Keep in mind, that this only works for Twitch streamers and YouTube
channels. # üéÄ Reaction roles! Reaction roles is a must need for every
bot. So how can I set up some? Honestly... It's very easy! 
1. First write the message where your reaction role should go!

2. Then add a reaction role using `~reaction roles add `. In my case
`` will be @Male. So I can type in `~reaction roles add @Male` 
3. Now you can choose between 3 different types of reaction roles:



4. The last step is to add your final reaction emoji. Just react to the
message you made in step 1!

 Now you added your own reaction role! Just repeat the steps for the
female reaction role and you're done! # üí° I have a cool idea! Well,
[I](https://discord.com/users/639544573114187797)'m still developing
Myra, so if I found a bug or have a cool feature suggestion, please join
my [Discord](https://discord.gg/nG4uKuB) and report/suggest i there!
